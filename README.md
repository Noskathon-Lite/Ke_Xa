###Overview
Our Health Emergency and Safety Web App is designed to meet essential needs in managing health crises and preparing for disasters. The app will provide real-time health risk information, earthquake alerts, and ambulance coordination, equipping users with the necessary tools to stay informed and take prompt action during emergencies.

Our App will feature the following key components:
1. Health Risk Heat-map: This will display real-time health risks, such as disease outbreaks and AQI levels, using color-coded indicators to guide user decisions.
2. Earthquake Alerts: Users will receive real-time earthquake warnings along with safety instructions tailored to their location.
3. Ambulance Coordination: The app will offer a list of nearby ambulances, complete with contact details and a call button for quick access in emergencies.
4. Interactive Symptom Checker: This tool will assist users in evaluating their symptoms and determining if they need medical attention.
5. Emergency Broadcast System: Users will receive notifications about local emergencies, including health risks and natural disasters.

By integrating these features into a single, user-friendly platform, our app will provide life-saving tools right at users' fingertips. With a focus on real-time, actionable data, it will empower individuals to safeguard their health and safety in both everyday situations and emergencies.

This initiative aligns with the theme of AI for Good & Climate Action through technology.
